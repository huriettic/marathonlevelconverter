# Marathon level converter

Marathon level converter for Unity portal rendering.

This project uses Weland to load and read map files.

Marathon 2 and Infinity map files can be loaded and saved as Json text file.

The text file is for the optimized portal rendering project.

I can't give you Marathon 2 and Infinity textures.
